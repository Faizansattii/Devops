3D Characterizer:A revolution in the field of Computer Vision
Introduction:
3C is a web-based application that is designed for creating a 3d model of humans. It uses deep learning and segmentation techniques to detect, train and process videos .User can upload 360 video that has his/her desired character. After uploading, the System converts the video into multiple frames e.g., a character’s image will be taken from one frame and blurred frames will be removed etc. The user can wait till the 3d model is processed. The system will give model file. The model can be imported in Blender or MeshLab then to Unreal Engine.

Problem Statement:
With a busy lifecycle nowadays, it’s hard to design a character in such a short time. It takes way too much time to design a character of a real-life person. It takes hours or even days to design a character. To save time, this project will be very helpful for game designers and graphic design who spend days to just make a single character for game.

People and even companies and utilize that time and human power in other tasks and leave the designing for the model. The model will generate the character which can be used to further edit or deploy inside the game.

Objective:
To provide an interactive and easy to use interface.

 To allow users to create their desired character online.

 To provide users a facility to import their character to their favorite application like MeshLab and Blender.

 To provide users a facility to import their generated character to their game development application like Unreal engine 5.

 To allow users to access their previous video as and when required.

 To allow users to access their previously generated 3D character as and when required.
